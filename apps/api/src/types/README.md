# Matthew's README for Implement Lesson GraphQL Queries

1. Types. I broke down the queries into types: Lessons, Author, and Paginated Lesson List. I will import these
   queries into the main `schema.ts` entry point, and begin building schemas for each now...

2. Lesson Type: the key : value pairs in the object are pairs I came up with in the meantime, I will need to look
   at the schemas to confirm what the object should look like. I will now do the same for author.

3. Schema folder: I will now create Pothos schemas in the schema folder, starting with `lesson` and trying to get
   that complete before moving onto next ones.
